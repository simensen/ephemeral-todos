## 2025-01-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create a PHP library for ephemeral todos that automatically manage todo lifecycle to reduce information overload in productivity applications. Target developers building todo systems that prioritize user focus over comprehensive tracking.

### Context

Traditional todo systems create overwhelming user experiences by maintaining permanent records of all todos and showing infinite future recurring events. Users abandon these systems due to cognitive overload and guilt from accumulated missed tasks.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Persistent Todo System**
   - Pros: Complete historical record, familiar pattern, simple implementation
   - Cons: Information overload, user abandonment, endless list growth

2. **Manual Cleanup Todo System**
   - Pros: User control, flexible management
   - Cons: Requires user discipline, still creates cognitive burden, inconsistent behavior

### Rationale

Automatic lifecycle management addresses the core problem of information overload while maintaining the essential reminder functionality. Focus on "just-in-time" todo creation and intelligent cleanup reduces cognitive burden without sacrificing usefulness.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduced user cognitive load and anxiety
- Self-maintaining todo lists that stay relevant
- Unique positioning in crowded todo application market
- Developer-friendly library approach enables wide adoption

**Negative:**
- Loss of historical todo data may concern some users
- More complex implementation than traditional systems
- Paradigm shift requires user education

## 2025-01-19: PHP Library Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement as a framework-agnostic PHP library using immutable objects, fluent interfaces, and trait-based composition. Minimize external dependencies and focus on domain logic rather than storage implementation.

### Context

Need to maximize adoption across PHP ecosystem while maintaining clean architecture that developers can easily understand and extend.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Laravel-Specific Package**
   - Pros: Deep framework integration, familiar patterns for Laravel developers
   - Cons: Limited to Laravel ecosystem, harder to port to other frameworks

2. **Full-Stack Application**
   - Pros: Complete solution, immediate usability
   - Cons: Limited flexibility, harder to integrate into existing applications

### Rationale

Library approach provides maximum flexibility for integration while maintaining clean separation of concerns. Immutable objects with fluent interfaces create intuitive developer experience that aligns with modern PHP practices.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Wide compatibility across PHP frameworks
- Clean, testable architecture
- Easy integration into existing applications
- Familiar patterns for PHP developers

**Negative:**
- Requires additional work for storage implementation
- May need framework-specific adapters for optimal integration

## 2025-01-19: Automatic Deletion Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Designer, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement multiple automatic deletion strategies based on completion status and time elapsed, allowing fine-grained control over todo lifecycle while maintaining simplicity for basic use cases.

### Context

Need to balance comprehensive lifecycle control with simplicity to avoid recreating the complexity problems of traditional systems.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Deletion Rule**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, easy to understand
   - Cons: Insufficient flexibility for real-world use cases

2. **User-Defined Scripting**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility
   - Cons: Too complex, requires programming knowledge from end users

### Rationale

Predefined strategies (AfterDueBy, AfterExistingFor) with completion awareness provide the right balance of flexibility and simplicity. Developers can choose appropriate strategies without overwhelming configuration options.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Flexible enough for diverse use cases
- Simple enough for quick implementation
- Predictable behavior for users
- Clear mental model for developers

**Negative:**
- More complex than single-rule approach
- Requires documentation to explain strategy differences
