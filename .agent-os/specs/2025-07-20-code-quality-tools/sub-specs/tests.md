# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-20-code-quality-tools/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Integration Tests

**Configuration Validation**
- EditorConfig file follows proper INI format and contains required settings
- PHP-CS-Fixer configuration file is valid and loads without errors
- PHPStan configuration file is valid and loads without errors
- Composer scripts execute successfully without errors

**Code Quality Enforcement**
- PHP-CS-Fixer can format the existing codebase without breaking functionality
- PHPStan analysis passes on the current codebase at specified level
- Both tools can be run via Composer scripts

### Functional Tests

**Command Execution**
- `composer fix` applies formatting rules correctly
- `composer analyse` reports analysis results
- `composer check` runs both tools in non-modifying mode
- Exit codes are appropriate for CI/CD integration (0 for success, non-zero for failures)

**CI/CD Integration**
- GitHub Actions workflow executes quality checks
- Quality check failures prevent merge/deployment
- Workflow provides clear feedback on quality issues

### Manual Verification Tests

**Editor Configuration**
- Verify EditorConfig settings are applied correctly by supported editors
- Test indentation behavior matches configured rules
- Confirm line ending and character encoding consistency

**Code Formatting**
- Intentionally introduce formatting issues and verify PHP-CS-Fixer corrects them
- Verify formatted code follows PER-CS, Symfony standards, and configured additional rules
- Confirm no functional changes are introduced by formatting

**Static Analysis**
- Introduce type errors and verify PHPStan catches them
- Test with various PHP versions to ensure compatibility
- Verify analysis time is reasonable for CI/CD pipeline

## Mocking Requirements

No external service mocking required for this specification as all tools operate on local files and code analysis.
