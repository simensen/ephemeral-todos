# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Code Quality Tools
> Created: 2025-07-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Configure EditorConfig, PHP-CS-Fixer, and PHPStan for automated code quality enforcement to ensure consistent code style across editors and catch potential bugs before they reach production.

## User Stories

### Library Maintainer Quality Assurance

As a library maintainer, I want automated code quality tools configured, so that the codebase maintains consistent style and catches potential bugs early in the development process.

The workflow includes setting up EditorConfig for consistent editor behavior across team members, configuring PHP-CS-Fixer with project-specific rules that align with modern PHP standards, configuring PHPStan for static analysis to catch type errors and potential bugs, and integrating all tools into the development workflow through Composer scripts and CI/CD pipeline.

### Developer Contribution Experience

As a contributing developer, I want code quality tools that automatically format my code and catch issues, so that I can focus on business logic without worrying about style consistency or basic type errors.

The experience includes having consistent editor behavior through EditorConfig, running `composer fix` to automatically format code, using `composer analyse` to check for static analysis issues, and having clear feedback when quality checks fail with specific line numbers and fix suggestions.

## Spec Scope

1. **EditorConfig Configuration** - Set up consistent editor behavior for indentation, line endings, and character encoding
2. **PHP-CS-Fixer Configuration** - Set up automated code formatting with PER-CS and Symfony standards
3. **PHPStan Configuration** - Configure static analysis for type checking and bug detection
4. **Composer Scripts** - Add convenient commands for running quality tools
5. **CI Integration** - Ensure quality checks run automatically in continuous integration

## Out of Scope

- Custom coding standards beyond established PHP community standards
- Complex PHPStan rules that might be too strict for a library
- IDE-specific configurations or editor plugins

## Expected Deliverable

1. Code formatting can be applied automatically with a single command
2. Static analysis identifies type errors and potential bugs with clear reports
3. Quality checks can be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline
