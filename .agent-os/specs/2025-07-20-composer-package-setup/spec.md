# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Composer Package Setup
> Created: 2025-07-20
> Status: Completed

## Overview

Prepare the ephemeral-todos library for professional distribution through Packagist by optimizing the composer.json configuration, ensuring compliance with Composer best practices, and setting up proper package metadata for discoverability and adoption by PHP developers.

## User Stories

### PHP Developer Package Discovery

As a PHP developer, I want to easily discover and install the ephemeral-todos library through Composer, so that I can quickly integrate ephemeral todo functionality into my applications without manual setup complexity.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer searches Packagist for "ephemeral todos" or "todo management", finds the package with clear description and keywords, runs `composer require simensen/ephemeral-todos`, and immediately has access to properly autoloaded classes with clear namespace structure.

### Package Maintainer Distribution

As the package maintainer, I want the library to be professionally packaged with proper metadata and versioning, so that it appears credible to developers and integrates seamlessly with modern PHP development workflows.

**Detailed Workflow:** Maintainer tags releases with semantic versioning, Packagist automatically pulls updates from GitHub, package metadata clearly communicates library purpose and compatibility, and developers can trust the package quality through proper configuration.

### Framework Developer Integration

As a framework developer, I want to easily understand the library's dependencies and compatibility requirements, so that I can confidently integrate it into my framework-specific packages without version conflicts.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer reviews composer.json to understand PHP version requirements, dependency constraints, and autoloading structure, then creates framework-specific adapters knowing the library will integrate cleanly with their dependency management.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Composer Metadata** - Complete package description, keywords, homepage, and support information for optimal Packagist presentation
2. **Dependency Optimization** - Refined version constraints and dependency organization for maximum compatibility
3. **Autoloading Configuration** - PSR-4 autoloading optimization and development autoloading setup
4. **Package Discovery Features** - Keywords, suggests, and replace directives for enhanced discoverability
5. **Distribution Readiness** - License verification, author information, and support channel configuration

## Out of Scope

- Packagist account creation (assumed to exist)
- GitHub repository configuration
- Documentation content creation (covered in separate spec)
- Actual version tagging and release process

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Optimized composer.json** - Professional package configuration ready for Packagist submission
2. **Package Validation** - Composer validate passes with no warnings or errors
3. **Installation Testing** - Package installs correctly via Composer in clean environment
