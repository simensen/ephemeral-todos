# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Traits Group 2 - Completion Awareness and Immutability Testing
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create reusable test traits to eliminate code duplication in completion awareness testing and immutability testing patterns across the test suite. This will standardize how we test these common behavioral patterns and reduce repetitive assertion code.

## User Stories

### Completion Awareness Testing Standardization

As a test developer, I want to use standardized test methods for completion awareness behavior, so that I don't have to duplicate the same assertion patterns across multiple test classes.

Multiple test classes (AfterDueByTest, AfterExistingForTest, CompletionAwareTest) contain nearly identical methods testing appliesWhenComplete(), appliesWhenIncomplete(), appliesAlways(), and configuration methods like andIsComplete(), andIsIncomplete(), whetherCompletedOrNot(). A reusable trait will eliminate this duplication and ensure consistent testing patterns.

### Immutability Testing Standardization

As a test developer, I want to use standardized test methods for immutability behavior, so that I can verify objects return new instances without writing repetitive assertNotSame() patterns.

Many domain objects use immutable patterns where method calls return new instances. Tests across AfterDueByTest, AfterExistingForTest, CompletionAwareTest, DefinitionTest, ManagesCronExpressionTest, and ScheduleTest contain similar immutability verification logic. A trait will standardize this testing approach.

## Spec Scope

1. **Completion Awareness Test Trait** - Standardized methods for testing completion-aware object behavior
2. **Immutability Test Trait** - Reusable methods for verifying object immutability patterns  
3. **Test Method Conversion** - Update existing tests to use the new traits
4. **Assertion Standardization** - Ensure consistent assertion patterns across all completion and immutability tests
5. **Documentation** - Usage examples and guidelines for the new test traits

## Out of Scope

- Changes to production completion awareness or immutability behavior
- Complex completion state scenarios (handled in individual test classes)
- Performance testing of immutable object creation
- Modification of core domain object interfaces

## Expected Deliverable

1. Standardized completion awareness testing methods available as a reusable trait
2. Standardized immutability testing methods available as a reusable trait
3. Existing tests converted to use new traits with no behavioral changes
4. Consistent assertion patterns across all completion awareness and immutability tests
5. Reduced code duplication in test classes that verify these behavioral patterns
