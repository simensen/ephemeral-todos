# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-test-traits-group-2/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Completion Awareness Test Trait

- Create trait `AssertsCompletionAwareness` with standardized test methods
- Provide method `assertHasCompletionAwareMethods($object)` to test basic completion methods
- Provide method `assertCanConfigureCompletionAwareness($object)` to test configuration methods
- Must work with any object implementing completion awareness interface
- Should handle edge cases like null returns or invalid states
- Must provide clear assertion failure messages

### Immutability Test Trait

- Create trait `AssertsImmutability` with standardized immutability testing methods
- Provide method `assertMethodReturnsNewInstance($object, $methodName, ...$args)`
- Provide method `assertMultipleMethodsReturnNewInstances($object, $methods)` for batch testing
- Must verify that method calls return different object instances (assertNotSame)
- Should support method calls with parameters
- Must provide clear assertion failure messages for immutability violations

### Integration Requirements

- Both traits must be compatible with PHPUnit and existing TestCase structure
- Traits should be usable together in the same test class
- Must maintain existing test behavior while reducing code duplication
- Should work with existing assertion patterns and not conflict with other test helpers

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Generic trait methods with reflection for dynamic method calls
- Pros: Highly flexible, works with any object/method combination
- Cons: Complex implementation, harder to debug, performance overhead

**Option B:** Specific trait methods for known patterns (Selected)
- Pros: Simple implementation, clear error messages, better IDE support
- Cons: Less flexible, may need updates for new patterns

**Rationale:** Option B provides better developer experience with clear method names and error messages. The completion awareness and immutability patterns are well-defined, so generic reflection-based approaches add unnecessary complexity.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. Implementation uses existing PHPUnit assertion methods and PHP object comparison functionality.
