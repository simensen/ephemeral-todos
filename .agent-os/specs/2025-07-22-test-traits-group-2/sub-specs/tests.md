## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**AssertsCompletionAwareness Trait**
- Test assertHasCompletionAwareMethods with valid completion-aware objects
- Test assertHasCompletionAwareMethods with invalid objects (should fail appropriately)
- Test assertCanConfigureCompletionAwareness with objects that support configuration
- Test trait methods provide clear error messages on assertion failures
- Test trait works with different completion-aware implementations

**AssertsImmutability Trait** 
- Test assertMethodReturnsNewInstance with immutable object method calls
- Test assertMethodReturnsNewInstance with methods that take parameters
- Test assertMultipleMethodsReturnNewInstances with batch method testing
- Test trait methods provide clear error messages when immutability is violated
- Test trait works with different immutable object implementations

### Integration Tests

**Completion Awareness Conversion**
- Test AfterDueByTest completion methods work identically after conversion
- Test AfterExistingForTest completion methods work identically after conversion  
- Test CompletionAwareTest methods work identically after conversion
- Test no behavioral changes in existing completion awareness tests
- Test trait usage reduces code duplication as expected

**Immutability Testing Conversion**
- Test AfterDueByTest immutability methods work identically after conversion
- Test AfterExistingForTest immutability methods work identically after conversion
- Test DefinitionTest immutability methods work identically after conversion
- Test other converted test classes maintain identical behavior
- Test trait usage reduces code duplication as expected

### Mocking Requirements

**Completion Awareness Testing**
- Mock completion-aware objects for trait testing
- Mock objects with invalid completion methods to test error handling

**Immutability Testing**
- Mock mutable objects to verify trait correctly identifies immutability violations
- No external service mocking required
