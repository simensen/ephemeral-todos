> Spec: Comprehensive Test Suite
> Created: 2025-07-19
> Status: Completed

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive PHPUnit test suite for the ephemeral-todos PHP library that covers all core functionality including domain objects, scheduling system, deletion management, and temporal calculations. This establishes the foundation for reliable library development and enables confident future feature additions.

## User Stories

### Reliable Library Foundation

As a PHP developer using the ephemeral-todos library, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can trust the library's behavior in my applications and be confident that updates won't introduce regressions.

The test suite will cover all core classes (Todo, Definition, FinalizedDefinition, Todos), scheduling system components (Schedule, Time, cron expressions), deletion management (AfterDueBy, AfterExistingFor), and temporal calculations. This ensures that developers can rely on predictable behavior when building todo management systems.

### Confident Feature Development

As a library maintainer, I want complete test coverage so that I can add new features and refactor existing code without breaking existing functionality.

The test suite will include unit tests for individual classes, integration tests for workflow scenarios, and time-based testing strategies to handle Carbon/DateTime dependencies. This enables safe evolution of the library while maintaining backwards compatibility.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unit Tests for Core Domain Objects** - Test Todo, Definition, FinalizedDefinition classes with all methods and edge cases
2. **Scheduling System Test Coverage** - Test Schedule, Time, cron expression handling, and temporal calculations
3. **Deletion Management Testing** - Test AfterDueBy, AfterExistingFor classes and completion-aware behavior
4. **Collection Management Tests** - Test Todos class for definition management and instance generation
5. **Integration Test Scenarios** - Test complete workflows from definition to todo instance creation
6. **PHPUnit Configuration Setup** - Configure test environment with proper autoloading and dependencies
7. **Mock Strategy Implementation** - Handle time-based testing with Carbon test helpers and mocking

## Out of Scope

- Performance benchmarking and load testing
- Framework-specific integration testing (Laravel, Symfony)
- Storage layer testing (will be covered in Phase 2)
- User interface testing
- Documentation generation from tests

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete PHPUnit test suite with 90%+ code coverage for all implemented classes
2. All tests passing consistently with predictable time-based behavior
3. Clear test organization structure that matches the library's architecture and is easy to extend
