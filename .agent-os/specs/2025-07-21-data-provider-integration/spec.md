# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Data Provider Integration and Validation
> Created: 2025-07-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement seamless PHPUnit data provider integration and comprehensive scenario validation that builds on the enhanced EphemeralTodoTestScenario and variation generators. This integration enables developers to easily generate PHPUnit data providers from scenario variations while providing robust validation to catch configuration errors early in development.

## User Stories

### PHPUnit Integration Story

As a PHP developer using the ephemeral-todos library, I want to seamlessly convert scenario variations into PHPUnit data providers, so that I can leverage PHPUnit's parameterized testing features without manually transforming scenario objects into data provider arrays.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developers will use methods like `VariationGenerator::priority()->completion()->toDataProvider()` to automatically generate properly formatted PHPUnit data provider arrays. The integration will handle naming conventions, parameter passing, and scenario serialization, allowing developers to focus on test logic rather than data provider mechanics.

### Validation and Error Prevention Story

As a library maintainer, I want comprehensive validation that catches scenario configuration errors before tests run, so that I can provide clear error messages and prevent confusing test failures due to invalid scenario setups.

**Detailed Workflow:** The validation system will check scenario consistency, validate temporal relationships, ensure deletion rules are compatible with scenario timing, and verify that completion states are logically consistent. When errors are found, the system will provide detailed error messages explaining what's wrong and how to fix it.

### Developer Experience Story

As a developer writing complex tests, I want helpful debugging tools and clear error messages when scenarios are misconfigured, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues without spending time debugging opaque test failures.

**Detailed Workflow:** The system will provide diagnostic methods like `scenario()->validateConfiguration()` and `scenario()->explainErrors()` that give detailed feedback about scenario validity. Error messages will include suggestions for fixes and reference documentation for proper usage patterns.

## Spec Scope

1. **PHPUnit Data Provider Generation** - Convert scenario variations and matrices into properly formatted PHPUnit data provider arrays
2. **Scenario Configuration Validation** - Comprehensive validation of scenario setups including temporal consistency and deletion rule compatibility
3. **Error Message System** - Clear, actionable error messages with fix suggestions and documentation references
4. **Debugging and Diagnostics** - Tools for scenario validation, configuration checking, and troubleshooting
5. **Provider Naming Conventions** - Intelligent naming for generated test cases based on scenario parameters

## Out of Scope

- Integration with testing frameworks other than PHPUnit
- Performance optimization for large data provider sets (future enhancement)
- GUI-based scenario validation tools
- Automatic scenario fixing or correction (validation only, not auto-repair)

## Expected Deliverable

1. DataProviderGenerator class in `Simensen\EphemeralTodos\Testing` namespace that converts variation generators into PHPUnit-compatible data provider arrays
2. ScenarioValidator class in `Simensen\EphemeralTodos\Testing` namespace with comprehensive validation rules and clear error reporting
3. Enhanced integration between VariationGenerator and PHPUnit testing workflows
