# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-test-providers-group-3/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Schedule/Cron Data Provider

- Create data provider method `scheduleMethodsProvider()` that returns method name and expected cron expression pairs
- Include all existing schedule convenience methods (daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- Create parameterized test method that uses the data provider to test schedule â†’ cron mapping
- Data provider should be easily maintainable when new schedule methods are added
- Must preserve existing assertion logic for schedule method testing

### Priority Testing Data Provider

- Create data provider method `priorityLevelsProvider()` that returns priority method names and expected values
- Include all priority levels: high, medium, low, none, default
- Create parameterized test method that uses data provider to test priority assignment
- Data provider should map priority method names (withHighPriority) to expected FinalizedDefinition behavior
- Must maintain existing test logic for priority verification

### TestScenarioBuilder Helpers

- Create helper methods for common TestScenarioBuilder configuration patterns
- Provide `createBasicScenario()` method for standard scenario setup
- Provide `assertScenarioProperties($scenario, $expectedProperties)` for common property assertions
- Create helper methods for scenario builder method chaining patterns
- Must work with existing TestScenarioBuilder API without modifications

### Integration Requirements

- Data providers must be compatible with PHPUnit data provider conventions
- Helper methods should integrate with existing TestCase structure
- Must maintain existing test behavior while reducing code duplication
- Should provide clear test names/descriptions in parameterized tests

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Single comprehensive data provider file with all mappings
- Pros: Centralized data, easy to maintain, single source of truth
- Cons: Large file, potential merge conflicts, tight coupling

**Option B:** Individual data providers in relevant test classes (Selected)
- Pros: Localized to relevant tests, easier to understand, better encapsulation
- Cons: Potential duplication if data providers are needed in multiple places

**Rationale:** Option B keeps data providers close to their usage, making them easier to understand and maintain. The schedule and priority data is specific to their respective test classes, so centralization doesn't provide significant benefits.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. Implementation uses existing PHPUnit data provider functionality and current TestScenarioBuilder implementation.
