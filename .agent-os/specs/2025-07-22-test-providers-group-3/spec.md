> Spec: Test Providers Group 3 - Data Providers and Builder Helpers
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create data providers and helper methods to eliminate code duplication in schedule/cron expression testing, priority testing, and TestScenarioBuilder usage patterns. This will standardize parameterized testing approaches and reduce repetitive test method patterns.

## User Stories

### Schedule/Cron Expression Data Provider Standardization

As a test developer, I want to use data providers for testing schedule methods and their corresponding cron expressions, so that I don't have to write individual test methods for each schedule convenience method.

ScheduleTest.php contains many individual test methods that follow the same pattern: create a schedule using a convenience method and assert it produces the expected cron expression. A data provider approach will eliminate this duplication while making it easier to add new schedule methods.

### Priority Testing Data Provider Standardization  

As a test developer, I want to use data providers for testing priority levels, so that I don't have to write separate test methods for each priority level (high, medium, low, none, default).

DefinitionTest.php contains multiple test methods that follow identical patterns for testing priority assignment (withHighPriority, withMediumPriority, etc.). A parameterized approach will eliminate this duplication and make priority testing more maintainable.

### TestScenarioBuilder Helper Standardization

As a test developer, I want standardized helper methods for common TestScenarioBuilder usage patterns, so that I don't have to repeat the same builder configuration and assertion patterns across multiple test classes.

Multiple test classes use TestScenarioBuilder with similar patterns for setup, configuration, and assertions. Helper methods will reduce this duplication and provide consistent testing approaches for scenario-based tests.

## Spec Scope

1. **Schedule/Cron Data Provider** - Parameterized testing for schedule convenience methods to cron expression mapping
2. **Priority Testing Data Provider** - Parameterized testing for all priority levels and their assignment methods
3. **TestScenarioBuilder Helpers** - Common helper methods and assertion patterns for scenario builder usage
4. **Test Method Conversion** - Convert existing individual test methods to use data providers
5. **Documentation** - Usage examples and guidelines for new data provider patterns

## Out of Scope

- Changes to production schedule or priority functionality
- Complex scenario builder features (handled in individual test classes)
- Performance optimization of data provider execution
- Modification of TestScenarioBuilder core functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. Data provider for schedule method to cron expression testing with all current schedule methods covered
2. Data provider for priority testing with all priority levels covered
3. Helper methods for common TestScenarioBuilder usage patterns
4. Existing repetitive test methods converted to use data providers
5. Reduced code duplication in schedule, priority, and scenario builder testing
